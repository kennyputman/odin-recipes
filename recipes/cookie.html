                        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch*</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup (1.5 sticks or 170g) unsalted butter, melted & slightly cooled*</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
                        <li>1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1 and 1/4 cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chocolate chunks</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="recipe-info-header">Instructions</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until
                            no
                            brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg, then the egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla
                            extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together with a large
                            spoon
                            or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, yet thick. Fold in the chocolate chunks.
                            They
                            may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them.
                            Cover
                            the dough and chill in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours or up to 3-4 days. Chilling is
                            mandatory.
                            I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading. (Some readers
                            have
                            asked if it’s possible to roll into balls and then chill, but I don’t recommend it. The
                            cookie
                            dough is quite sticky and loose to section into balls before chilling.)</li>
                        <li>Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow to slightly soften at room temperature for
                            10
                            minutes.</li>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone
                            baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Roll the dough into balls, about 3 Tablespoons of dough each. The dough will be crumbly, but
                            the
                            warmth of your hands will help the balls stay together. Roll the cookie dough balls to be
                            taller
                            rather than wide, to ensure the cookies will bake up to be thick. See this post for more
                            detail
                            and a photo. Place 8 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet. Press a few more chocolate
                            chips/chunks on top of the dough balls for looks, if desired.</li>
                        <li>Bake the cookies for 12-13 minutes. The cookies will look very soft and underbaked. They
                            will
                            continue to bake on the cookie sheet. Allow to cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes
                            before
                            transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                        <li>Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.</li>
