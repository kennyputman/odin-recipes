                    This luxurious ice cream is the ideal balance of sweet yet salty and rich yet light. It's
                    custard-based,
                    which means you have to separate a lot of eggs (six), but the thick and silky results are worth a
                    little
                    bit of fuss. For something a little lighter, use more milk and less cream, as long as the dairy adds
                    up
                    to three cups. You can also cut down on egg yolks for a thinner base, but don’t go below three.
                    Despite
                    the rumors, making caramel is not hard, but it can be a little tricky. If this is your first time,
                    make
                    sure you have enough sugar for a second batch in the event your first is a bust. Also, remove the
                    cooking caramel from the heat just before you think you need to to prevent burning.

                    <li>In a medium pot over medium heat, melt 3/4 cup sugar with 3 tablespoons water, swirling skillet
                        frequently, until sugar turns mahogany brown in color (it should be almost but not quite black).
                    </li>
                    <li>Add heavy cream, milk, remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the salt; simmer mixture until caramel melts
                        and
                        cream mixture is completely smooth. Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks.
                        Whisking
                        constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk
                        mixture
                        back into the pot with the cream.</li>
