                    <p>
                        I’ve never made successful baked pumpkin donuts before this year. Until I began to think a
                        little
                        more clearly, previous attempts have resulted in flavorless donut-shaped orange circles. My mini
                        cinnamon sugar pumpkin muffins are donut-like, but it wasn’t until I transformed my favorite
                        pumpkin
                        muffins into cake-like donuts that I was truly satisfied with a traditional pumpkin donut. Um
                        hello?
                        Why didn’t I do that sooner? Regardless, this pumpkin donut recipe is certainly worth the wait!

                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li> 1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

                        <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
                        <li> 2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                        <li> 1 cup (227g) fresh or canned pumpkin puree</li>
                        <li>1/3 cup (80ml) milk</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown suga</li>
                        <li> 1/4 cup (60ml) milk</li>
                        <li> 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                        <li> 1 and 1/2 cups (175g) sifted confectioners’ sugar</li>
                        <li>1 Tablespoon (14g) unsalted butter</li>
                        <li>pinch of salt, to taste</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="steps recipe-info-container">
                    <p class="recipe-info-header">Instructions</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Spray donut pan with non-stick spray. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Make the donuts: Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin
                            pie
                            spice together in a large bowl until combined. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the oil,
                            brown
                            sugar, eggs, pumpkin puree, milk, and vanilla extract together until combined. Pour the wet
                            ingredients into the dry ingredients, then fold everything together gently just until
                            combined
                            and no flour pockets remain.</li>
                        <li>Spoon the batter into the donut cavities or for ease, I highly recommend using a large
                            zipped-top bag. Cut a corner off the bottom of the bag and pipe the batter into each donut
                            cup,
                            filling about halfway.</li>
                        <li>Bake for 10-11 minutes or until the edges and tops are lightly browned. To test, poke your
                            finger into the top of the donut. If the donut bounces back, they’re done. Cool donuts in
                            the
                            pan for 2 minutes then transfer to a wire rack. Re-grease the pan and bake the remaining
                            donut
                            batter. *For mini donuts, bake in a mini donut pan for 8-9 minutes. Cool donuts for at least
                            10
                            minutes before icing them.</li>
                        <li>Make the icing: Combine the brown sugar, milk, and butter in a medium saucepan over medium
                            heat.
                            Stir until the butter has melted and mixture is smooth. Bring to a simmer. Allow to simmer
                            for 1
                            minute then remove from heat and whisk in the vanilla extract and sifted confectioners’
                            sugar
                            until smooth and combined. Taste, then add a pinch of salt if desired– I always add a tiny
                            pinch. Let the icing cool for 5 minutes to slightly thicken. Dip the tops of the pumpkin
                            donuts
                            into the warm icing. If icing is getting too thick as you’re dipping, add a little more milk
                            or
                            warm back up in the microwave or on the stove to thin out. Place dipped donuts on a wire
                            rack
                            placed on a baking sheet so any excess icing can drip off. Top with chopped nuts or other
                            toppings if desired. If applied lightly, the icing will eventually set in about 1 hour so
                            you
                            can stack or transport the donuts.</li>
                        <li>
                            Cover leftover donuts tightly and store at room temperature for 1-2 days or in the
                            refrigerator
                            for up to 1 week.</li>
